# Razor Blade - Scrapped Ideas

This document lists ideas we had but decided against it, so that the decisions are documented.

## Scrapped Enhancements to Page

1. Icon (ideally auto-set the type based on the file extension image/png vs image/x-icon)  
Scrapped, because this usually should be set in the theme-page and not in razor. Once razor can be used for themes, this would change.
1. AddStyle  
Scrapped, as this should usually be the CDF
1. AddLink (link tag...)  
Scrapped, as this should usually be the CDF
